Bugs

TODOs
- Merkle proofs
- Bitcoin node settings read into api (fees etc.)
- What happens to txs in metamorph when a transaction source is registered after the block is processed in blocktx?
- BlockTx processing seems to be slow on Prod, with Postgres
- Log failing txs in full? (in api and/or metamorph)
- Monitoring API / metamorph / blocktx / callbacker
- Documentation (Siggi)
- API yaml cleanup
- Extended format - add option to send bare transactions
- More deterministic when sending tx to nodes
- Cleanup metamorph store after 100 block confirmations
- Cleanup blocktx store after ...?
- Re-look at tests in processor_test.go after logic changes
- Store which peer we sent a transaction to, to only re-send to that peer

Need to figure out
- Connect to more than 1 node -> can we force our nodes to accept our connections?
- Different strategy for batcher, wait for x millis or wait for no activity for x millis ?
