Bugs

TODOs
- Merkle proofs
- Bitcoin node settings read into api (fees etc.)
- What happens to txs in metamorph when a transaction source is registered after the block is processed in blocktx?
- BlockTx processing seems to be slow on Prod, with Postgres
- Log failing txs in full? (in api and/or metamorph)
- Monitoring API / metamorph / blocktx / callbacker
- Documentation (Siggi)
- API yaml cleanup
- Gracefully disconnect Peers in metamorph and blocktx on shutdown

Need to figure out
- Connect to more than 1 node -> can we force our nodes to accept our connections?
