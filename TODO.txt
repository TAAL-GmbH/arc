Bugs

TODOs
- Reconnecting to Bitcoin nodes after disconnect
- API yaml cleanup
- Bitcoin node settings read into api (fees etc.)
- Monitoring API / metamorph / blocktx / callbacker - Grafana / Logstash?
- Documentation (Siggi)
- Cleanup metamorph store after 100 block confirmations
- Cleanup blocktx store after ...?

Testing
- Wrong sats on input or double spend gets us banned from a node, REJECT messages are sent properly over p2p

Need to figure out
- Connect to more than 1 node -> can we force our nodes to accept our connections?
- What happens to txs in metamorph when a transaction source is registered after the block is processed in blocktx?

Icebox
- Merkle proofs
